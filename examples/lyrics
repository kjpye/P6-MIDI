  To dream the im- pos- si- ble dream,
  To fight the un- beat- a- ble foe,
  To bear with un- bear- a- ble sor- row,
  To run where the brave dare not go;
  To right the un- right- a- ble wrong,
  To love, pure and chaste, from a- far,
  To try, when your arms are too wear- y,
  To reach the un- reach- a- ble star!

  This is my Quest to fol- low that star,
  No mat- ter how hope- less, no mat- ter how far,
  To fight for the right with- out ques- tion or pause,
  To be wil- ling to march in- to hell for a heav- en- ly cause!
  And I know, if I'll on- ly be true to this glor- i- ous Quest,
  That my heart will lie peace- ful and calm when I'm laid to my rest,
  And the world will be bet- ter for this,
  That one man, scorned and cov- ered with scars,
  Still strove, with his last ounce of cour- age,
  To reach the un- reach- a- ble stars!
